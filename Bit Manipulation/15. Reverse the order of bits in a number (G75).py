# Reverse the order of bits in a number:

'''
Given a non-negative integer n. The problem is to reverse the bits of n and print the number obtained after reversing the bits. Note that the actual binary representation of the number is being considered for reversing the bits, no leadings 0â€™s are being considered.
Examples : 
 

    Input : 11
    Output : 13
    Explanation: (11)10 = (1011)2.
    After reversing the bits we get:
    (1101)2 = (13)10.

    Input : 10
    Output : 5
    Explanation : (10)10 = (1010)2.
    After reversing the bits we get:
    (0101)2 = (101)2
            = (5)10

def reverseBits(n):
    rev = 0
    for in in range(32):
        rev = rev << 1 # Reversal logic to XOR with 1 in later stage
        if(n & 1 == 1):
            rev = rev ^ 1
        n = n >> 1
    return rev

n = 4
reverse = reverseBits(n)
print(reverse)
