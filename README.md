Linked list
-----------------
1. Determine if there is a cycle or not
2. If there is a cycle, return the node where the cycle begins
3. Find the node where two linked lists intersect
4. Remove Nth node from end of the list
5. Reverse linked list
6. Remove linked list elements of a given value
7. Group all odd nodes and even nodes together in order
8. Palindrome linked list
9. Merge two sorted linked lists
10. Insert into a cyclic sorted linked list
11. Rotate linked list by K places
12. XOR linked list
13. Reverse linked list in blocks of K

Arrays
-----------
1. Find pivot index (where sum of numbers to left = sum of numbers to right)
2. Diagonal traverse and print
3. Spiral matrix
4. Implement strstr()
5. Two pointer technique - reverse string, array partition
6. Two pointer - one fast runner, one slow runner - remove element in one scan, max consecutive 1's, minimum size subareay sum, rotate array
7. Reverse words in a string - word by word, reverse within a word and maintain the order
8. Remove duplicates from sorted array
9. Move all zeroes to the end
10. Max sub array sum - DP

2. Implement stack using queues and queue using stacks
3. Valid parentheses
4. Circular buffer/Ring buffer

Sorting
-----------
1. Selection sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Insertion sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort

Searching
